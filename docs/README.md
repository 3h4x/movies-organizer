## About
A (simple) program that'll automatically bulk rename and organise your **Movie and TV-Shows Library** (ideal for maintaining your *xbmc* library). Movies and TV Shows are easily organized by your xbmc if they're given the right name.
#### Why do I do it?
This boosts my frequently updated massive media library organised almost instantly.
#### What's New !
* `[ADDED]` Fallback mode if unable to detect a TV Show.
* `[ADDED]` Automatic Subtitle Downloader.
* `[UPDATE]` Uses **imDB** to retrieve the most relevent movie and series names.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
What things you need to run the program:
- Python Compiler (3.7 Recommended)
- Install the following Packages from pypi by using the following commands:
  - **strsim** and **imdbpy**
    ```bash

    pip install imdbpy
    ```

## Usage
* Step 1: Move all the media files that are to be renamed and organised into "/Input" folder.
